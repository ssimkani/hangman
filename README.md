# Hangman

## Description

This is a game of Hangman created using Ruby as part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Curriculum. It includes the ability to save and load previous games that are stored inside of the `saved_games` directory. This game can be played in the command line by running `ruby main.rb` from the `hangman` directory.
